\begin{frame}{About me}
    % - First learned about Haskell at university from a friend
    % - Pretty deep into Ruby and Lua at that time
    % - So thanks for redeeming me
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Discovered FP at Uni, haven't looked back
    \item Contributed to and authored open source projects
    \item Worked with Haskell for some companies
    \item Currently at Fugue
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fugue}
    % - I think the idea of Fugue fairly simple
    % - Express everything beautifuly, concisely in a composable way
    % - Fugue makes it so
    % - Eventually taken very liberally
    %
    % - The language in which you specify infrastructure but also rules is
    %   called Ludwig
    % - Only a small part of Fugue uses Haskell but we have fully adopted the
    %   functional mindset
    % - Immutable infrastructure encouraged
    \emph{Fugue} is a cloud orchestration platform that offers a variety of
    services \\
    \vspaced
    The single source of truth for Fugue is defined in a functional,
    statically typed language called \emph{Ludwig} \\
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{FP and Infrastructure}
    % - This is case study talk, an experience report
    % - What are our reasons for using FP
    % - What language features are important to us?
    % - How do we teach functional programming?
    % - Can't say "Go read category book"
    This talk is about our experience with applying FP to this domain that
    encompasses a few different topics such as compliance, DevOps, immutability
    infrastructure\ldots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{FP and Infrastructure}
    % - This is a technical conference so I don't want to convert anyone today
    % - But if you're using CFN, why not generate it from Haskell
    % - Or lisp, but then you'd run into trouble LOL
    % - Make you think about configuration management, especially as it relates
    %   to cloud since there's a lot of it
    % - If your config is less than 100 lines you probably don't care
    I'm using Ludwig as a case study but most things in this talk generalize to
    other languages which share the traits we all love such as Hindleyâ€“Milner
    type inference, referential transparency, immutability, row types\ldots
\end{frame}

% - Don't want to get philosophical dont worry
% - Also dont want to get too theoretic
% - But it's "configuration management" and nobody seems to have a clue what
%   management entails so it would be good if we could talk about at least one
%   of these two words
\chapterslide{What's in a configuration?}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Keeping it Simple\textsuperscript{\tiny{TM}} with JSON}
    % - Simple example to start with
    % - Records
    % - Some different values of different types
    % - Lists as well
    % - There's also INI config file format (or any of the thousand)
    % - What's the advantage of JSON?  You can put JSON in JSON!!!
    \begin{lstlisting}
    {
      "loadBalancer": {
        "port": 80,
        "name": "my-elb",
        ...
      }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Keeping it Simple\textsuperscript{\tiny{TM}} with JSON}
    % - Immutable means that I'm not modify to change it 10 lines down
    % - That you don't need to browse through it to figure out state
    % - Things have types I suppose
    % - JSON schemas are a thing and are actually not that bad
    % - Tooling is ATROCIOUS
    %
    % - Making the step to typed will give us many, many advantages...
    Common (sane) configuration use cases of JSON are already: \\
    \vspaced
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Immutable
    \item \emph{Mostly} typed
    \end{itemize}
    \vspaced
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Types}
    % - I've now changed this JSON to Ludwig
    % - The quotes dissapeared
    % - This makes it easy to learn: its just JSON
    % - if you're not doing anything advanced its just JSON with good errors
    \begin{lstlisting}
    {
      loadBalancer: {
        port: 80,
        name: "my-elb",
        ...
      }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Types}
    % - We can actually look at the type now
    % - Record typing, even typescript has (some form of it)
    % - There's a few different approaches and I'll get into that a bit later
    % - Simple to read, intuitive to understand, simple to infer(?)
    \begin{lstlisting}
    {
      loadBalancer: {
        port: Int,
        name: String,
        ...
      }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Types}
    % - I'm the author of NGINX
    % - I provide a type definition of the config I expect
    % - People can browse it, check it
    % - Prevents a class of weird runtime errors
    % - Always typed, port == Int
    % - Some things are just... weirdly typed, unsound, no principal times
    % - Show multiple errors VS show one error VS runtime BOOM
    % - An example can never be exhaustive
    % - Dependent types PLEASE
    What happens if we write a type definition for our JSON configuration? \\
    \vspaced
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Generate \emph{useful} error messages
    \item Show multiple errors at once!
    \item Generate documentation
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Types}
    % - I firmly believe
    % - Outweigh the downsides
    % - Slower on startup only
    % - Client request to your webserver should still be JSON
    % - More bugs, bigger to install, harder to embed, more to learn
    There's always downsides\ldots
    \vspaced
    \begin{itemize}
    \item No more \texttt{[null, 4, "Four"]}
    \item Obviously \emph{significantly} slower
    \item Additional components means more complexity
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Types}
    % - My favorite paper (or its in my top three)
    % - Present this at local Zurich papers we love
    % - Offers more power than what we need
    % - At the same time being simpler than what we want
    %
    % - Error messages are not great though
    % - Need some special cases
    % - But yeah I think error messages are hard, not enough formalization
    %   around here
    There are many ways to infer types \\
    For configuration management, row types are \emph{really} important \\

% - Is this all needed?
% - Anonymous functions
% - Let bindings etc
% - Hell yeah I want that
\chapterslide{Why such a ``complex'' system?}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Configuration is Hard}
    % - NGINX config
    % - I thought you said you dont allow nesting
    % - Well there is some nesting, sometimes allowed, sometimes disallowed
    %   which is even weirder
    % - Oh I guess `index.html` is a list like thing?  I hope it's clearly not a
    %   filename with spaces in there
    % - But alright alright alright I'll confess this is pretty simple
    \begin{lstlisting}
    server {
      listen      80;
      server_name localhost;
      location / {
        root   html;

\blackslide{Two weeks later\ldots}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Configuration is Hard}
    % - Maybe it's a nightmare and you wake up
    % - But you must've gotten these nightmares somewhere
    % - I suppose it's a programming language heavily inspired by bash
    % - When I think a language needs more power I look at Lisp, Haksell but
    %   even sometimes C, Python (which has some great ideas)
    \begin{lstlisting}
    if ( $remote_addr != 10.11.12.13 ) {

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Keeping it Simple\textsuperscript{\tiny{TM}} with YAML}
    % - So right I'm not gonna invent my own flat format
    % - Let's use structured YAML
    % - This is simple and nice, plus types
    % - Oh look it's immutable (and Ansible got that right)
    % - Actually not really immutable, but at least Idempotent
    % - The language doesn't actively prevent this
    \begin{lstlisting}
    - name: add my user
      user:
        name: "jasper"
        state: present
        groups: "wheel"
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\blackslide{Ten minutes later...}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Keeping it ``Simple''\textsuperscript{\tiny{TM}} with YAML}
    % - The type depends on `with_items` being present
    % - I don't think dependent types can capture that elegantly and even if
    %   they can I wouldn't want to implement that
    % - Is this lexically scoped?  Maybe
    % - Is this always called item?
    % - What if I want to call it something else or differently?
    % - Or a nested loop?  I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS
    \begin{lstlisting}
    - name: add several users
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
        groups: "wheel"
      with_items:
         - testuser1
         - testuser2
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Configuration is Hard}
    % - I hope everyone is familiar with this
    % - Scripting language
    % - If you don't look existing research
    % - Most famous example: VIM
    % - I am a VIM user myself but I can't really configure it too well because
    %   I've never bothered learning VIMSCRIPT
    % - But I envy Emacs users when it comes to their extensible configuration
    %   format
    %
    % - So I would like to propose an analogue
    % - Any sufficiently advanced configuration format contains an ad-hoc,
    %   informally specified, bug-ridden slow implementation of for loops and if
    %

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Control structures}
    % - We can only do this BECAUSE we quoted my-elb and because we didn't quote
    %   port
    % - It can go in two ways: we reserve space for it, or we add it from the
    %   beginning
    % - We're not gonna need it, and build on the assumption that you don't need
    %   it
    %
    % - I'm using sum types here.  That's pretty good for modelling Prod/Dev
    % - Because you could add a param, but I digress
    % - It's easy to read
    %
    % - Not spaghetti!  We can't modify anything!
    Embrace control structures rather than half-heartedly bolting them
    on! \\

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Control structures}
    % - What else is nice about Haskell?
    % - We don't have for loops
    % - But we have LIST COMPREHENSIONS
    % - Surprisingly people are familiar with this (THANKS PYTHON)
    % - Python's list comprehensions aren't nested but the idea is easy
    \begin{lstlisting}
    loadBalancers: [
      {
        port: port
        name: name
        ...
      } for (port, name) in elbList
    ]
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Control structures}
    % - Yes we have list comprehensions so we can repeat things
    % - But not accross different files
    % - Not very readable
    Even \emph{with} powerful control structures we still end up copying
    pasting the same lines of codes from stackoverflow\ldots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    What we really want is some form of stored \emph{examples}, \emph{templates}
    or \emph{recipes} that we can customize to our needs, but they should
    \emph{compose} well and not interfere with each other\ldots
